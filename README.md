# Project: Motor Performance Analysis with Different Propellers and Batteries

## Overview

This project focuses on evaluating the performance of a motor (dji 2212/920 kV) under varying conditions by measuring thrust, RPM, voltage, and current. The tests were conducted using two types of propellers—plastic and carbon—and two types of batteries: 3S1P and 4S1P.

## Tests Conducted
